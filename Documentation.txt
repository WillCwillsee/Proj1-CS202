This project took me a great deal of time and I struggled with very basic things initially.  However, once I started figure out how to declare and implement the functions so that they worked, things got easier.  However I am not entirely sure that the way I phrased the parameters in the declaration and implementation is correct, so I will have to continue learning about these things.  I started just reading from the file and then storing to an array.  Then I began figuring out how to make the functionality of the program work before I took that functionality and stored it in actual functions which could be called.  Once I figured out most of the required functionality I cleaned things up and began commenting.  Next time I will make a header file which has my comments and documentations from the beginning so that I can build that alongside building the functionality.
